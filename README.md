# Description
Widget for the mac OS of the [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) application. It allows you to change the wallpaper on your desktop, including live wallpaper.

# Usage
Change the settings in the `settings.json`.
First, set the type of the desired media file in the `type` property, it can be "video" (mp4, mov, avi...) or "image" (gif, jpeg, png...).
The `isLocal` flag indicates whether your media file is local. If not, the source will be the file to which the URL from the `src` property leads. If yes, the source will be your local file, the name of which should be written in the `fileName` property.


# Installation
Just clone the repository to the widgets folder, which Ubersmith will help you navigate to.
